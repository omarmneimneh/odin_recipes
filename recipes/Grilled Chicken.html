    <h1>Grilled Chicken Recipe</h1>
    <p>Grilled chicken is arguably one of the easiest things to make but a lot of people tend to mess it up not because they don't know how to cook, but because without taking the proper steps, chicken breast can easily dry out due to the lack of fat on it. Fret not however, because with a few simple tweaks, you'll be on your way to making the best chicken breast you and anyone you serve it to has ever had. </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1-3/4 lbs boneless, skinless chicken breasts</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</li>    
        <li>4 large garlic cloves, minced</li>    
        <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>1-1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li> One at a time, place the chicken breasts in a 1-gallon zip-lock bag; using a meat mallet, pound to an even Â½-inch thickness.</li> 
        <li>Mix all of the ingredients except for the chicken together in a 1-gallon zip-lock bag (go ahead and use the same one you used for pounding if it is still in good shape). Add the chicken breasts to the bag and massage the marinade into the meat until evenly coated. Seal the bag and place in a bowl in the refrigerator (the bowl protects against leakage); let the chicken marinate for at least 4 hours or overnight.</li> 
        <li>        Preheat the grill to high heat and oil the grates. Place the chicken breasts on the grill and cook, covered, for 2 to 3 minutes per side. Do not overcook. Transfer the chicken to a platter and serve.</li>
    </ol>
