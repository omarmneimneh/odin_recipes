    <li>1/2 teaspoon dried oregano</li>  
        
    <li>Pinch crushed red pepper flakes</li> 
        
    <li>1 cup water, broth or dry red wine</li> 
        
    <li>1 (28-ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>

    <li>Handful fresh basil leaves, plus more for serving</li> 
        
    <li>12 ounces dried spaghetti or favorite pasta shape</li>

<h3>Directions</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Heat the oil in a large pot over medium-high heat (we use a Dutch oven). Add the meat and cook until browned, about 8 minutes. As the meat cooks, use a wooden spoon to break it up into smaller crumbles.</li>  
    <li>Add the onions and cook, stirring every once and a while, until softened, about 5 minutes.</li> 
    <li>Stir in the garlic, tomato paste, oregano, and red pepper flakes and cook, stirring continuously for about 1 minute.</li> 
    <li>Pour in the water and use a wooden spoon to scrape up any bits of meat or onion stuck to the bottom of the pot. Stir in the tomatoes, 3/4 teaspoon of salt, and a generous pinch of black pepper. Bring the sauce to a low simmer. Cook, uncovered, at a low simmer for 25 minutes. As it cooks, stir and taste the sauce a few times so you can adjust the seasoning accordingly.</li> 
    <li>Cook pasta to box instructions</li>
